# My Interactive 3D Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal creative portfolio! This isn't just a standard webpage; it's a fully interactive experience designed to showcase my skills in web development, 3D graphics, and animation. The project features a dynamic space-themed background, cool micro-interactions, and a clean, modern design.

## ✨ Features

This portfolio is packed with features designed to create an engaging user experience:

* **🚀 Interactive 3D Space Animation:** A stunning, animated solar system created with `Three.js`. It includes an orbiting planetary system, a distant "Milky Way" starfield, and interactive asteroids you can click to destroy!
* **🌌 Animated Pre-loader:** A custom loading screen with the message "Welcome to my portfolio - AMBUJ" and a beautiful expanding gradient circle ensures a smooth entry into the site.
* **🛸 Unique Cursor Effect:** A custom-designed, non-intrusive cursor with a continuous ripple animation that follows your mouse movements.
* **💫 Animated Profile Picture:** My profile picture is surrounded by multiple, intricately animated rings that pulse and rotate, creating a unique visual focus.
* **📱 Fully Responsive Design:** The entire layout is built to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **📝 Functional Contact Form:** A sleek, "glassmorphism" style contact form that submits directly to a Formspree endpoint, complete with status messages for submission success or failure.
* **🪄 Smooth Animations & Transitions:** Sections and project cards fade in gracefully as you scroll, and buttons have a magnetic hover effect for a premium feel.
